# Kasper - Creative Agency Template

This is the second major project in my intensive **100-day journey** to become a professional front-end developer. "Kasper" is a fully responsive, multi-section landing page for a fictional creative agency, built from scratch using advanced HTML5 and CSS3 techniques.

## About The Project

Building upon the fundamentals from my first project, "Kasper" introduces a significant step up in complexity. The primary goal was to tackle more advanced CSS challenges, including intricate layouts, background image effects, and pseudo-element styling, to create a polished and dynamic user experience.

## üß† What I Learned

This project was instrumental in deepening my CSS skills. Key learnings include:

* **Mastering Complex Layouts:** Gained extensive practice building nested and complex layouts combining both **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**.
* **Advanced Background Techniques:** Learned how to effectively use advanced background techniques, including image overlays and implementing **HTML5 video as a background element**.
* **Reusable Components with Pseudo-elements:** Discovered the power of `::before` and `::after` for adding intricate design details, particularly in creating the reusable main heading component seen throughout the page.
* **Building a Component-Based Mindset:** This project served as an introduction to thinking in components. I practiced this by creating a reusable styling pattern for the main heading, which was used consistently across all sections of the page.
